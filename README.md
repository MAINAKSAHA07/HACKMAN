# HackMan Solution - User Registration and Dashboard

Welcome to **HackMan Solution**, a vibrant and stylish website designed to provide a funky and dynamic user experience. This project includes a user registration and login system with facial recognition features and an interactive, visually appealing dashboard inspired by the **Amazon AWS Manager Side**.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive website for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **New User Registration**:
  - Users register with their **email**, **first name**, **last name**, and capture **four images** from different angles for facial recognition.
  - Images are stored in `.png` format (simulated in the frontend).
- **Existing User Login**:
  - Users log in with their email and facial recognition, which is matched against the stored images (simulated for now).
- **Stylish and Funky Dashboard**:
  - The dashboard features **bold colors**, **vibrant fonts**, and **dynamic charts**.
  - It includes a "Developed By" page showcasing team members with their images and short bios.
  - An interactive **Security Awareness** section, explaining the importance of cybersecurity and user data protection.

## Pages Overview

1. **Landing Page**: Offers options for new and existing users.
2. **Registration Page**: A form for user details and image capture for facial recognition.
3. **Login Page**: Email authentication and facial recognition for existing users.
4. **Dashboard**:
   - User's activity summary, profile details, and facial recognition status.
   - Customizable widgets and charts.
   - Security Awareness section discussing the importance of data privacy and cybersecurity.
   - A "Developed By" page featuring images and bios of the development team.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (or React for a more dynamic structure)
  - CSS for animations and responsiveness
  - **React Router** for page navigation
- **Development Tools**:
  - **Vite** for fast development and bundling
  - **Node.js** (to simulate backend data in future versions)
  
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **Vite**: This project uses Vite as the development tool.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hackman-solution.git
   cd hackman-solution
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Issues and Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues like unresolved imports or missing files (e.g., `Dashboard.tsx`), follow these steps:

1. Verify the file path and ensure the required file exists (e.g., `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`).
2. Clear the Vite cache and restart the development server:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Implement full backend functionality for storing and retrieving user data and images.
- **Facial Recognition**: Integrate actual facial recognition APIs to match user images during login.
- **More Interactive Components**: Add more widgets and charts to the dashboard to provide a richer user experience.
